Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Using OpenCV and EasyOCR

This project demonstrates how to implement Optical Character Recognition (OCR) using Python with the help of OpenCV for image preprocessing and EasyOCR for text extraction.

Features
>Image Preprocessing: Utilizes OpenCV for tasks such as resizing, thresholding, and noise reduction to enhance OCR performance.
>Text Recognition: Extracts text from images using the EasyOCR library.
>Visualization: Displays processed images and extracted text.

Dependencies
>Python 3.7+
>numpy
>opencv-python
>EasyOCR
>matplotlib

Install the required packages with
>pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Clone the repository:
>git clone https://github.com/your-username/ocr-opencv-easyocr.git cd ocr-opencv-easyocr
Open the Jupyter Notebook
>jupyter notebook "Optical Character Recognition using OpenCV and EasyOCR.ipynb"

Follow the steps in the notebook:
>1]Load your image file for OCR processing.
>2]Preprocess the image using OpenCV functions (e.g., grayscale conversion, noise reduction).
>3]Extract text using EasyOCR and visualize the results.

Customization
>Modify preprocessing steps in the notebook to suit specific image characteristics.
>Add support for additional languages by updating EasyOCR's Reader initialization.
